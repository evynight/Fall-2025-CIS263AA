The IDE I have settled on is VS Code. After I had gleefully uninstalled jGRASP from both my PC and laptop, I reached out to a few friends of mine who are professional programmers to ask which IDE they recommend. The answer I universally received was VS Code. From what I gathered, it's more or less the industry standard. Given that, I figure learning how to use it now will benefit me in the long run.
